        <h3> <strong> Breaded Air Fryer Pork Chops </strong></h3>
        <p>Perfectly tender and juicy pork chops are what you'll get in just 10 minutes using your air fryer and basic pantry ingredients.</p> 
        <p>Play around with different crouton flavors for variety. I like to use a Misto® sprayer with my own oil, but feel free to use regular cooking spray.</p>
